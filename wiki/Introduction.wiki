<b><u>Introduction</b></u>
The wavsep project is aimed to assist security researchers, analysts, consultants, QA engineers and software developers in evaluating the various features of web application vulnerability scanners.
<b><u>Details</b></u>
The project currently focuses on accuracy evaluation, by presenting a series of vulnerability challenges for web application scanners, in order to verify which unique instances can be detected by the evaluated products.
The project structure is designed around directories containing isolated vulnerabilities â€“ 
Each one of the vulnerability-based directories focuses on a single vulnerability, with multiple test cases that attempt to simulate specific instances of the vulnerability (although each test case might be vulnerable to additional security exposures).
The project is implemented as a web application which is implemented in JSP, and contains a JSP page that serves as a database installer.
Although it runs on both Linux and Windows, in order for all the test cases to function properly, it's best to install the application on Windows (10+ LFI test cases).
